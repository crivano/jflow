Project JFlow
====
JLogic is a simple open-source library for defining and running workflows in java. It is specifically designed to be easily included in other applications.

Main goals are:
- To be fast
- To be easily readable
- To have a simple user interface to edit workflow definitions
- To support persistence on different databases

Development
====

JFlow is very much in-development, and is in no way, shape, or form guaranteed to be stable or bug-free.  Bugs, suggestions, or pull requests are all very welcome.
